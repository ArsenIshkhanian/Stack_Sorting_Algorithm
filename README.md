# 🗂️ Stack Sorting Algorithm

This Python function sorts a stack (represented as a list) using an auxiliary stack,  
demonstrating an in-place sorting technique without using built-in sort methods.

---

## How it works

- Pops elements from the original stack one by one  
- Uses a temporary stack to reorder elements in ascending order  
- Moves elements back to original stack when needed to maintain order
